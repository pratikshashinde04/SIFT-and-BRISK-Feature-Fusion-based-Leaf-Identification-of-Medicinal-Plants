# SIFT-and-BRISK-Feature-Fusion-based-Leaf-Identification-of-Medicinal-Plants

### Overview
SIFT-and-BRISK-Feature-Fusion-based-Leaf-Identification-of-Medicinal-Plants is an innovative project focused on the identification and characterization of Ayurvedic medicinal plants through digital image processing and machine learning techniques. This project leverages the fusion of SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints) feature extraction methods to analyze leaf images and identify various medicinal plant species with high accuracy.

### Features
- **Leaf Image Dataset**: A comprehensive collection of 2220 high-resolution images (4160 x 3120 pixels) from 9 distinct medicinal plants.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes SIFT and BRISK methods for robust feature extraction from leaf images.
- **Machine Learning**: Employs SVM for classifying medicinal plants based on extracted features.
- **Web Application Prototype**: Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time plant identification.

### Methodology
1. **Dataset Collection**: Images of leaves from 9 medicinal plants were collected from natural habitats.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images were resized, converted to RGB, and enhanced using Gaussian blur and histogram equalization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Keypoints and descriptors were extracted using SIFT and BRISK.
4. **Classification**: Machine Learning algorithms (SVM, RF, GNB, KNN) was used to classify plants based on the extracted features.
5. **Web Application**: A prototype web application was developed to evaluate the model's real-world applicability.

### Dataset
The dataset includes images from the following plants:
- Aloe Vera
- Argemone Mexicana
- Giloy
- Guava
- Adulsa
- Neem
- Sandalwood
- Tulsi
- Giant Milkweed

### System Architecture
The system architecture involves several stages:
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Standardizes the dataset by resizing and enhancing images.
2. **Feature Extraction**: SIFT and BRISK extract meaningful features from the preprocessed images.
3. **Classification**: Machine learning algorithms categorize the medicinal plants based on the extracted features.

### Results
The proposed system achieved high accuracy in classifying medicinal plants, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining SIFT and BRISK features with SVM classifiers. The web application prototype also showed promising results in practical scenarios.
